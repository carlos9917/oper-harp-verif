\section{Introduction}
\sectionrule
This contribution summarizes the work carried out by Polly Schmederer in contribution with Fabrizio Baordo
and Carlos Peralta during the ACCORD-funded visit of Polly in June 2024.

The purpose of the visit was to extend the capabilities of the \panels tool \cite{panel_tool} developed at GeoSphere to include additional scores and variables. 
Additionally, the use of the \retis package \cite{reticulate}, that provides an interface to the python language from the R language, was also considered.
The whole development is shared in a github repository that includes installation instructions and example data sets \cite{repo}.

A detailed description of the code developments is presented below, along with application examples and future work.

%Generalising spatial verifications: 
%\begin{itemize}
%    \item improving R scripting in 
%    \item use of the \retis package to interface R with Python;
%    \item generalise/apply the \panels tool
%    \item providing examples.
%\end{itemize}



\section{Overview of the repository}

\subsection{Reading functions}
\subsection{Panelification}
\subsection{Configuration files}
\subsection{Installation instructions}
\section{Data used for spatial verification}

The headings of main sections are underlined. This is achieved by the new command "sectionrule".

\section{Application examples}

An example of a Table is given in \ref{tab:grib}. Please feel free to make a more fancy one if you like.

\begin{table}
{\center\it\caption{ \label{tab:grib}Extract of the GRIB header section 1}}
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{lrr}
                                        & HIRLAM & ECMWF \\
 Parameter identifier (Code Table 2).   &   122  & 146 \\
 Type of level (Code Table 3).          &   105  &   1 \\
 Time unit (Code Table 4).              &     1  &   1 \\
 Time range one.                        &     0  &   6 \\
 Time range two.                        &     6  &   0 \\
 Time range indicator (Code Table 5)    &     4  &   0 \\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\end{table} 

\subsection{Figure layout}
Figures have to be provided in high resolution, preferably in Encapulated PostScript (eps) format, or ".png", ".jpg" or ".gif". 
\textbf{Please, NO .PS files (PDFLaTeX cannot use .ps image files to produce a .pdf file).}
In principle it is best to provide me seperately the image files that are closest to the creating source and have not yet been converted into another format.

The picture caption is placed under the picture, in italic, for example see Figure \ref{fig:O3}.

Please be careful with the size of your picture. LibreOffice has tools to reduce the size of the .pdf file created from your article (with reducing the definition of the pictures). It's not the case with latex (or I don't know how to do that), thus the pictures you provide should have reasonable size.

\begin{figure}[ht] %[h*]
\begin{center}
  \centerline{
   \epsfig{file=./exemple.eps,scale=0.6}
  }
\end{center}
  {\center\it\caption{\label{fig:O3}
   Title of my figure}}
