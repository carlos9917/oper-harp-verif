# Installation instructions to use the R and python libraries
Instructions below are focused on using the scripts
in the ECMWF atos machine.
Since the installation makes heavy use of github, it is
a good idea to create a personal token in github. 

## Creating a personal token in github

Occasionally the harp installation can fail with a message like:
``` r
Downloading GitHub repo andrew-MET/harp@master
Error: HTTP error 403.
 API rate limit exceeded for 130.226.71.190. (But here's the good news: Authenticated requests get a hi
gher rate limit. Check out the documentation for more details.)
```
or:
``` r
Error: Failed to install 'unknown package' from GitHub:
```

If this happens, if you already have a personal token, this must be added to the file '.Renviron' in your home:

``` r
touch ~/.Renviron and edit to add GITHUB_PAT=thetokenabove
```

If you do not have a token, follow the instructions [here](https://happygitwithr.com/https-pat.html#get-a-pat) 

Note that to add the token to .Renviron, you can also follow these instructions:

``` r
gitcreds::gitcreds_set()
<Enter token here>
```
Then use:
``` r
usethis::edit_r_environ()
```
This will open an editor to edit the file `.Renviron`, where you can write GITHUB_PAT=thetokenabove.

The system will ask you to restart R to take effect. Then try to install harp again.

Keep the personal token in your `.Renviron` for later use. The system will detect it an use it every time you use `install_github`


## Steps followed to install HARP in atos

In order to use the harp libraries it is recommended
to use a local environment created with the `renv` library.
The local environment can be created from scratch using the instructions below.


**Create renv from scratch**

Choose the path you want where to have your local instalaltion:

cd <harp_local_installation>

Module we used (load before sunig R)  
```
module load R
module load ecmwf-toolbox  # this one is necessary to install Rgrib2 dependencies
module load proj
module load hdf5

This gives the following default moduels (June 2024)
R/4.3.3
hdf5/1.14.3
ecmwf-toolbox/2024.04.0.0
proj/9.3.1
```

```
Start R session

library(renv)
renv::init()
Exit R (ctrl-D or exit)
```
Once the renv environment is initiated, enter R again and install
the following libraries

```
Start R session

install.packages("remotes")
library(remotes)
install_github("harphub/harp")
install_github("pollyaschm/harpIO", "invert-hdf5-data")
install_github("pollyaschm/harpSpatial", "ACCORD_VS_202406")
```

When installing install_github("pollyaschm/harpSpatial", "ACCORD_VS_202406"), do not update other packages (option 3: None) 

```
Changes for harpIO/harpSpatial

harpIO:
changes to read_hdf5()
  
harpSpatial:
fc_param_defs input to read_grid()
prm$basename input to read_grid()      
prm$basename to force IR and WV satellite channels as the same parameter     
return fields from verify_spatial()     
adding scores in verify_spatial() (like RMSE, corr coef, percentage FSS) 
```

Proceed with the installation of the remaining packages.

```
install_github("harphub/Rgrib2")
```

Install hdf5 (needed when you need to access hdf files, e.g. DMI radar products)

When working in atos, follow the instructions below.
If working in any other machine, this step should not be necessary.

```
Exit R (ctrl-D or exit)

mkdir ~/.R/Makevars
in Makevars add: PKG_LIBS = $(HDF5_LIB)

Start R session

install.packages("hdf5r")

Exit R (ctrl-D or exit)

After successful installation remove the `Makevars` file, as this might interfere with the installation of other packages.
remove ~/.R/Makevars 
```

Keep installing packages

```
Start R session

install.packages("reticulate")
install.packages("here")
install.packages("tidyverse")
install.packages("dplyr")
install.packages("ggpubr")
install.packages("RColorBrewer")
install.packages("ggplotify")
install.packages("patchwork")
```

In case you need to handle netcdf files

```
module load netcdf
Start R session
install.packages("ncdf4")
```

After starting R in your <harp_local_installation> you should see a message like this, pointing
to a local R installation and not the standard `$HOME/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu-library`:

```
- Project '/etc/ecmwf/nfs/dh1_perm_b/miag/ACCORD_VS/testing/installHarp' loaded. [renv 1.0.7]
```

To update `renv.lock` after installation use:

```
renv::settings$snapshot.type("all")
renv::snapshot()
```

## Additional dependencies 

### When using reticulate to interface with python
(More info in reading_functions.py)

We use:

```
module load python3 (python3/3.11.8-01)
module load ecmwf-toolbox (ecmwf-toolbox/2024.04.0.0, to have available the python metview interface)  
```

We need a virtual enviroment where satpy is installed (satpy is used to ahndle MSG data)

Install your own python env:

```
python -m venv satpy
pip install satpy
```

or you might source /perm/miag/venvs/satpy/bin/python3 ('rx' permissions for accord group)

### Note on "non standard" grib parameters

```
When reading grib files which contain unknown parameters, as the precipitation parameters of DEODE:

* Modify the ECCODE grib definitions accordingly (see definitions/).

* Add ECCODE DEFINITION_PATH to your .bashrc:
  export ECCODES_DEFINITION_PATH=<path_to_definitions>/definitions:ECCODES_DEFINITION_PATH
```
