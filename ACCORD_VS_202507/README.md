# Draft folder for harpSpatial development

## Libraries installation
Currently installing these.
Maybe makes more sense using my fork of harpSpatial dev version?

```
Start R session

install.packages("remotes")
library(remotes)
install_github("harphub/harp")
install_github("harphub/harpIO", "develop")
install_github("harphub/harpCore", "develop")
install_github("harphub/harpSpatial", "develop")
```
