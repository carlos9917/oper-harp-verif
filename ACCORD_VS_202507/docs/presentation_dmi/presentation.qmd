## Introduction

This presentation provides a summary of the key findings from the ACCORD VS 202507 report. The report focuses on the verification of the HARP spatial verification methods.

---

## Methods

The study utilizes various spatial verification techniques to assess the performance of the HARP model. Key methods include:

-   **SAL (Structure, Amplitude, Location)**: A feature-based method.
-   **FSS (Fractions Skill Score)**: A neighborhood-based method.
-   **Object-based methods**: Identifying and comparing objects in forecasts and observations.

---

## Key Findings 1: Overall Performance

The HARP model shows good performance in predicting the location and structure of weather events. However, there are some discrepancies in amplitude, particularly for high-intensity events.

---

## Key Findings 2: Impact of Orography

Orography plays a significant role in the model's performance. The verification results show that the model's accuracy is lower in areas with complex terrain.

---

## Key Findings 3: Case Studies

The case studies highlight specific events where the model performed well and where it struggled. For example, the model had difficulty with convective events in the summer.

---

## Visualizations

The report includes several visualizations to illustrate the findings. Here are some examples:

---

## Challenges and Limitations

The main challenges in this study were:

-   The availability of high-resolution observation data.
-   The computational cost of running the verification methods.

---

## Conclusion

The HARP model is a valuable tool for weather forecasting, but there is room for improvement, especially in predicting the amplitude of events and in handling complex terrain.

---

## Future Work

Future work should focus on:

-   Improving the model's physics to better represent convection.
-   Developing new verification methods that are more robust to observation uncertainty.
