# harp-verif
A set of R scripts to carry out point verification using the [harp](https://harphub.github.io/harp/) package. These scripts are generally just wrappers in R to harp functions and are designed to carry out the full RRJVSP (Read forecasts, Read obs, Join, Verify, Save, and Plot) workflow.

The scripts require vfld and vobs data (e.g. from a HARMONIE-AROME experiment), or the equivalent forecast and observation sqlite tables, as input, and can perform the following tasks:
- Conversion of vfld/vobs data to sqlite format.
- Point verification of deterministic or ensemble forecasts over multiple groups, producing verification rds files which can be visualised using ``harpVis::shiny_plot_point_verif``.
- Plotting a set of standard verification scores, producing png files which can be visualised using the local shiny app provided in this repo.
- Scorecard generation.
- Extraction of point data from grib/ICM files.

Please see the documentation for details on how to run the point verification workflow. Note that the scripts largely follow the methodology outlined in the harp [2022](https://harphub.github.io/harp-training-2022/index.html) and [2024](https://harphub.github.io/harp_training_2024/) training courses, to which users are referred to for background information. 

A description of the contents of this repo is given below. Directories which are not relevant to the point verification workflow are *marked in italics*.

## config_files

The majority of verification options (e.g. leadtimes, models, paths etc.) are set via a configuration file. Several examples are included:

- ``config_det_example.yml``: A sample config file for when dealing with determinstic models.
- ``config_eps_example.yml``: A sample config file for using ensemble data.
- ``config_eps_ctrl_example.yml``: A sample config file for comparing individual members from multiple ensembles (e.g. the control member of each).

## docs

Documentation on how to use the point verification scripts is [available in this tutorial](docs/Tutorial.md).

## pre_processing

Scripts to pre-process the data:
- ``vobs2sql.R``: Convert vobs files to sqlite.
- ``vfld2sql.R``: Convert vfld files to sqlite.
- ``extract_point_param.R``: Extract point data from grib or ICM and save to rds.
- ``pull_dates_sql.R``: Query what dates are available in a given sqlite file.

## *spatial_verif*

Spatial verificaiton against radar data. Currently under development.

## verification

The main verification script:
- ``point_verif.R``: Perform point verification for deterministic or ensemble models over various groups (e.g. ``lead_time``, ``valid_dttm``, ``SID``, etc.). By default harp rds files are produced, while a set of png files for standard verification metrics will also be generated if indicated in the config file. Scorecard generation is also available via a flag in the config file. 
- ``set_params.R``: Defines scalings, thresholds, and quality control settings for parameters appearing in the vfld/vobs files or sqlite tables (e.g. T2m, Q). See ``harpIO::show_param_definitions()`` and ``harpIO::harp_params`` for more details, e.g.:
``` r
unlist(harp_params)[grep("harp_param",names(unlist(harp_params)))]
```
- ``fn_verif_helpers.R``: Contains various common functions for pre-processing and verification.
- ``fn_station_selection.R``: Used to define and generate SID lists. These SID lists can either be explicitly defined by users, or can be generated by looking for all stations within a given geographic regions (i.e. a lat/lon bounding box). New regions can also be defined by users. SID lists generated from geographic regions are contained in ``sid_lists.rds``.
- ``source_options.R``: A file specifying the options required by ``point_verif.R`` when sourcing the verification script within R/RStudio. Running the scripts in interactive mode is useful for querying data, for example.
- ``allsynop_sids.list``: All SIDs from HARMONIE-AROME's ``allsynop.list``.

## visualization

Plotting and visualization scripts:

- ``fn_plot_point_verif.R``: The main wrapper script for generating pngs during point verification.
- ``fn_plot_aux_scores.R``: Used to generate auxiliary scores which are/were not in harp by default (e.g. forecast timeseries).
- ``fn_plot_helpers.R``: Contains various plotting functions.
- ``fn_scorecard_signif.R``: A wrapper for plotting scorecards and model differences.
- ``fn_plot_signif_diff.R``: Plots the difference between two models and the confidence of that difference (from Andrew Singleton).
- ``fn_plot_tile_scorecard.R``: An alternative plotting tool for scorecard data.
- ``visapp/app.R``: A simple shiny app to display static png images. See the documentation for further instructions.
- ``visapp/sample_images``: Sample images to use for testing app functionality.
- ``visapp/all_experiment_names.R``: A tool for changing the display name of experiments in the app.
- ``visapp/sample_style.css``: Style settings for the app.

## Package dependencies

Instructions for harp installation can be found [here](https://harphub.github.io/harp_training_2024/get-started.html). Installation can take some time due to the larger number of dependencies. The latest release of the point verification scripts is compatible with harp version 0.2.2. To install a specific release of harp, use:
``` r
remotes::install_github("harphub/harp@v0.2.2")
```
Quite often a hotfix may be applied to the ``develop`` branch of a specific harp repository (e.g. ``harpPoint``) which is not yet in an official release. In order to get this update, you can use:
``` r
remotes::install_github("harphub/harpPoint@develop")
```
